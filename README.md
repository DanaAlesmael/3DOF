# 3DOF

In this task, a specific 3DoF arm robot was analyzed using both forward and inverse kinematics. 

In forward kinematic, the end effector coordinates and full angles should be found. 
In inverse kinematic, the angles of all joints should be found. The following points can summarize the steps:


The following points can summarize the steps:
* Using right triangle identities (as seen here: https://www2.clarku.edu/faculty/djoyce/trig/formulas.html), the unkown parameters were found in terms of the arm's length, cos and sin.
* All final equations can be further simplifies using trigonometric identities to find a specific value (as seen here: https://sites.google.com/site/trigridgestyle/home/table-of-contents/chapter-5-lessons/lesson-1-trigonometric-identities).
